            You are a highly knowledgeable medical assistant AI. A doctor requires a differential diagnosis report for a patient.
            Provide a structured report in Markdown format based on the following patient data.

            **IMPORTANT**: This report is for a qualified medical professional for informational and decision-support purposes only. It is NOT a definitive diagnosis.

            **Patient Demographics:**
            - Age: ${worker.age}
            - Gender: ${worker.gender}
            - Originating State: ${worker.nativeState}
            - Occupation: (Assume general labor or specify if available)

            **Clinical Data:**
            - Symptoms: ${symptoms || 'Not provided'}
            - Vitals:
                - Blood Pressure: ${vitals?.bloodPressure || 'N/A'}
                - Heart Rate: ${vitals?.heartRate || 'N/A'} bpm
                - Temperature: ${vitals?.temperature || 'N/A'} Â°F
            - Doctor's Notes: ${clinicalNotes || 'Not provided'}

            **Instructions for the Report:**
            Please generate a report with the following sections in Markdown:
            1.  **## Possible Conditions:** List 3-5 possible medical conditions, from most likely to least likely.
            2.  **## Reasoning:** For each condition, provide a brief explanation of why it's a possibility based on the provided data (symptoms, demographics, occupation, regional health risks).
            3.  **## Recommended Next Steps:** Suggest relevant diagnostic tests (e.g., Blood Tests, X-rays) or specific questions the doctor could ask the patient to narrow down the possibilities.
            4.  **## Disclaimer:** Reiterate that this is an AI-generated report for decision support and not a substitute for professional medical judgment.
